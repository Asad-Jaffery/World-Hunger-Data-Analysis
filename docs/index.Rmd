## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)

source("../source/summary_information.R")
source("../source/undernourishment_chart_1_code_source.R")
source("../source/country_wide_chart_2_code_source.R")

```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above

msg <- highest_underweight()
msg
```



## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# Summary of datasets:
Since we are studying world hunger, we decided to use our in order to determine which countries are in the worst conditions and which are in the best conditions. `r highest_underweight1` is the country that has the highest percentage of population that is considered to be 'underweight', while `r lowest_underweightr` is the country with the lowest percentage of underweight population. Next, we examined our undernourishment data set in order to find that `r highest_undernourishment1` is the country with the highest percentage of population undernourished, whereas `r lowest_undernourishment1`, are all tied for the lowest percentage of population of undernourished. Lastly, it is important to understand the global hunger index (GHI), which tracks hunger by region. `r highest_GHI1` has the highest GHI score, and `r lowest_GHI1` are all tied for the lowest.
