## Introduction
Hunger and undernourishment are some of the leading causes of severe or fatal health consequences globally, especially in children. The main issue is lack of access to food resources and a well balanced diet. By 2030, the United Nations set a target to “end hunger” as part of their [Sustainable Development](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) goals. Looking at this dataset, however, hunger and undernourishment is still a problem around the world, even if percentages have declined. We plan to address the issue of undernourishment, by looking at the trends around the world through this dataset, and to highlight which countries need more support than others in food supply and dietary education. By measuring which populations have the largest percentage of insufficient diets, action can be taken to truly end world hunger.

## Problem Domain
After a steady decline over the last decade, world hunger is again, on the rise. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a brutal effect on the entire world, especially those on the brink of starvation. Unfortunately, world hunger has reached nearly 10 percent since 2019, and the problem seems to only be getting worse as the global rate of inflation is also rising [(World Against Hunger)](https://www.actionagainsthunger.org/the-hunger-crisis/world-hunger-facts/). Thus, we have decided to pick a data set that studies the rates of hunger in 176 countries around the world, on a year by year basis in hopes to contribute to the fight against hunger.

#### Direct and Indirect Stakeholders
The people who are directly involved with the data (direct stakeholders) are those who are getting an insufficient caloric intake. Since the data set we are looking at examines 176 countries, these people can be located in any of these countries. Individuals who would be examining this data, or using it creating solutions for the issue of world hunger would be people who are indirect stakeholders.

#### Human Values
The idea of attaining access to food being a human right is widely accepted. Infact, the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 'enshrined’ that idea after the right to food was recognized as a right to an adequate standard of living in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights [(Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights)](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Publications/FactSheet34en.pdf). Thus, the stance that we are taking, is one of forward progression. Every human has a right to food, and the issue of hunger is one that we, as privileged individuals, are attempting to alleviate. Our human values are intrinsic rights that every human being should have.

#### Potential Benefits
Besides the fact that every human has a right to a balanced, and full diet, studying world hunger, and eventually reaching zero hunger, has the potential to benefit the entire world in many ways. For instance: education. Studies have shown that children with a balanced diet, and a full caloric intake are able to be more energetic in the classroom, and perform better in the academic environment [(The Borgen Project)](https://borgenproject.org/effects-of-hunger-on-education/). This also implies a more efficient world economy, as better education rates result in a more sustainable workforce.

#### Our job
The harms of human starvation start with the moral obligation that we all have. As humans who have full access to technology, education, and food, it is our job to do our part in helping those who were born into less fortunate circumstances. Thus, we have chosen to do our project on hunger rates around the world, since hunger is a prerequisite for many other privileges that we have (see ‘Potential Benefits’).

## Research Questions

How has hunger and undernourishment progressed on a global scale, what trends have become apparent during the early twenty-first century?

What countries have been hit hardest by the problems of hunger and undernourishment in the first decade of the 2000s and the second decade of the 2000s, is there any relation between the two?

How has the price of common food goods in all countries affected by hunger and undernourishment(defined as a % of population greater than 10%) from the years 2003 to 2020 affected the rates of hunger and undernourishment?

## The Dataset

Prevalence-of-undernourishment.csv, Measures the percentage of population which has an insufficient amount of caloric intake to meet the minimum requirement for energy needs for any given population. 3344 Unique observations. 4 separate variables.

This data set allows us to easily determine the countries which are most greatly affected by hunger. To go along with this, this set of data provides nearly two decades of tracking which allows us to look for trends on both a global and country scale. Originally publish online at OurWorldInData.org by Max Roser and Hannah Ritchie in 2019 in the article Hunger and Undernourishment

Global_food_prices.csv, Global Food Price data from 76 unique countries and 1,500 markets, data pulled from the World Food Programme, goods tracked include beans, fish, maize, rice and sugar dating as far back as 1992. 2,050,000 observations, 18 separate variables

## Expected Implications

Assuming that we find the answer to world hunger, there are many implications around it. First off, we must implement the model we have created, starting with the countries with the largest sheer number of individuals who are starving, as from a utilitarian perspective, that would be the most ‘moral’ implementation. Next, we would expect the rate of education to increase, as children can now focus on school (one of the next objectives would be to increase education access to those who don’t already have it).  After doing so, the economic implications would start to show, as countries who were struggling with starvation would be able to focus on building that proper infrastructure to support their economy.


## Limitations

- The first limitation to using this dataset is that the data fails to represent all people within a country. Many undernourished people or those struggling with hunger may live in remote areas, where they will be missed by the statisticians. Additionally, not every country across the globe has an accurate way to measure total census, therefore, the percentage of hunger (which is based on the main population) may not be accurate. One way to address this limitation is to create a universal system for tracking population changes. This could be one system where every person is entered, that way all data remains true to the times.

- Another limitation in trying to solve the problem of world hunger is the disconnect between the data, policies, and actual implementation. Though this data is helpful to support policies that would push for more incentives to improve nourishment, it is very difficult to carry out actions and resources, making them readily accessible for everyone. Just by looking at these statistics little can actually be done to end world hunger, however, these statistics are the first steps in highlighting the problem, and thus the first steps in making change.
